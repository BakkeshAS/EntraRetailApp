**Business Applications Programming**
 
## Problem statement

Please complete the following assignment and submit your solution online by Friday 15th January @ 5 pm at the latest. Your submission should consist of two parts 

(A) your full application solution folder (zipped) to the designated dropbox on Blackboard, and 

(B) your developer’s manual (incl. client profile and system specification) and the source code of your application in its appendix to the Turnitin dropbox. Note only one submission per assignment is accepted.

**Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) Application**

You are asked to develop a simple EPOS system for a retail business of your choice i.e., specialist retailer, restaurant, service provider.

Your client will use the EPOS to process and record sales of item/service to their customers, provide inventory management to keep on top of stock levels, and provide real-time and comprehensive reports that allows them to make better business decisions.

Each EPOS system is required to have the following particulars and use the components specified in the manner prescribed on the next page. Particulars

• Each business should have a minimum of 65 stock items (e.g., a retailer might sell 13 types of an item in 5 different sizes).

• Each stock item will have its own price, and stock level.

• Your EPOS needs to support the purchasing of several different items in the same transaction.

• Your EPOS should not allow sales of items that are out of stock to be processed– i.e., a live count of stock for each item must be maintained.

**Required Constructs / Behavior in Your EPOS**
You are expected to use the programming components, constructs and best practices detailed over the 12 weeks in the module when developing your application. The following are specific programming constructs/ behaviors that are required to be part of your system specification.

• Arrays & Lists

Specific system requirement using this construct: the user should be able to search customer transactions (1:1, 1 to M) stored in a suitable collection. o Specific system requirement using this construct: if/as requested a suitability formatted daily sales report per item should be generated and saved to text file (in debug folder).

• Multi Form

Specific system requirement using this construct: the system should generate a suitability formatted management stock report and display in a separate form if/as requested.

• File IO

Specific system requirement using this construct: Stock values should be read into a collection in your application from file at the start of each day (opening stock) and read out at the end of each day (closing stock) (file within debug folder). 

**Deliverables**

(A) A client profile and general system specification [Max 2 pages - Exc. Screenshots/images].

(B) A project folder containing your developed application that meets your client’s specified needs.

(C) A developer’s manual detailing the application development process you followed in implementing your system [Max 10 Pages - Exc. Screenshots/images]
